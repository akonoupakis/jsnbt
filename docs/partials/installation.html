STRAP

	Download a copy of jsnbt-strap-angular from https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular
	This is a quick bootstrap to strart you up.

	Put the files in a folder of your choice, and lets have a look.

FILES

	package.json
		the file should have filled the grunt dependencies that will be needed.
		also, the "main" attribute that points to the module's index file!

	bower.json
		specify here the bower dependencies that your site will need.
		the "deploy" section of this config file, guides the system to copy the downloaded files to a target location (we will see later, that this target location is the lib folder within our app)

	config.js
		specify here the web server and database settings for each deployment target (dev/prod)

	gruntfile.js
		this is used by the grunt task runner to bundle the site to a deployment target folder (dev/dist) in order to be started by the node web server.
		the jsnbt grunt process is fairly complicated, so it has been embedded in the jsnbt core code and will be covered in next chapters.
		in your gruntfile, you should point the grunt function to jsnbt/src/app/grunt.js

	src/app/index.js
		this is the entry point of your site to the cms engine. (we will go through the module index file in next chapters)

	server-dev.js
	server-prod.js
		runs the application on the respective deployment target


INSTALL

	point to the app folder and:
	run "npm install" to install all the dependencies in package.json
	run "npm install jsnbt --save" to install jsnbt

RUN
	run "grunt dev" or "grunt prod" to grunt the app (this also downloads any bower components needed)
	run "node server-dev.js" or "node server-prod.js" to run the app


DONE
	you can hit the /admin section to create your first sa user and access the administration panel and
	you can hit the /dashboard section for the deployd dashboard
