<p>
    First, download a copy of jsnbt-strap-angular from <a href="https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular" target="_blank">https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular</a>.
    <br />
    This is a quick bootstrap to strart you up. Put the files in a folder of your choice, and lets have a look at a few of them.
</p>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>package.json</h4>
        <p>
            The file should have filled the grunt dependencies that will be needed.
            <br />
            Also, the "main" attribute that points to the module's index file!
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>hosts.js</h4>
        <p>
            This is the hosting configuration file. This should be kept out of source control systems and should not be overriden during deployment.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>gulpfile.js</h4>
        <p>
            This is used by the gulp task runner to bundle the site to the deployment target folder (/www) in order to be started by the node web server.
            <br />
            The jsnbt gulp process is fairly complicated, so it has been embedded in the jsnbt core code and will be covered in next chapters.
            <br />
            In your gulpfile, you should point the gulp function to <b>jsnbt/gulpfile.js</b>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>src/app/index.js</h4>
        <p>This is the entry point of your site to the cms engine. We will go through the module index file in next chapters.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>src/cfg/config.js</h4>
        <p>This is the configuration file of your site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>src/web/bower.json</h4>
        <p>
            Specify here the bower dependencies that your site will need.
            <br />
            The "deploy" section of this config file, guides the system to copy the downloaded files to a target location (we will see later, that this target location is the lib folder within our app).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>server-app.js</h4>
        <p>
            Runs the application in node.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>install</h3>
<p>
    Point to the app folder and:
    <br />
    Run <b>npm install</b> to install all dependencies.
    <br />
    Run <b>npm install jsnbt --save</b> to install jsnbt.
</p>
<h3>run</h3>
<p>
    Run <b>gulp dev</b> or <b>gulp prod</b> to structure-up the app (this also downloads any bower components needed).
    <br />
    Run <b>node server-app.js</b> to run the app.
</p>
<h3>you're done</h3>
<p>
    You can hit the /admin section to create your first sa user and access the administration panel.
