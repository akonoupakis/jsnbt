            First, download a copy of jsnbt-strap-angular from <a href="https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular" target="_blank">https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular</a>.
            <br />
            This is a quick bootstrap to strart you up. Put the files in a folder of your choice, and lets have a look at a few of them
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>package.json</h4>
                <p>
                    the file should have filled the grunt dependencies that will be needed.
                    <br />
                    also, the "main" attribute that points to the module's index file!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>bower.json</h4>
                <p>
                    specify here the bower dependencies that your site will need.
                    <br />
                    the "deploy" section of this config file, guides the system to copy the downloaded files to a target location (we will see later, that this target location is the lib folder within our app)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>config.js</h4>
                <p>specify here the web server and database settings for each deployment target (dev/prod)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>gruntfile.js</h4>
                <p>
                    this is used by the grunt task runner to bundle the site to a deployment target folder (dev/dist) in order to be started by the node web server.
                    <br />
                    the jsnbt grunt process is fairly complicated, so it has been embedded in the jsnbt core code and will be covered in next chapters.
                    <br />
                    in your gruntfile, you should point the grunt function to jsnbt/src/app/grunt.js
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>src/app/index.js</h4>
                <p>this is the entry point of your site to the cms engine. (we will go through the module index file in next chapters)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>src/app/config.js</h4>
                <p>this is the configuration file of your site.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>server-dev.js / server-prod.js</h4>
                <p>
                    runs the application on the respective deployment target
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>install</h3>
        <p>
            point to the app folder and:
            <br />
            run <b>npm install</b> to install all dependencies
            <br />
            run <b>npm install jsnbt --save</b> to install jsnbt
        </p>
        <h3>run</h3>
        <p>
            run <b>grunt dev</b> or <b>grunt prod</b> to grunt the app (this also downloads any bower components needed)
            <br />
            run <b>node server-dev.js</b> or <b>node server-prod.js</b> to run the app
        </p>
        <h3>you're done</h3>
        <p>
            you can hit the /admin section to create your first sa user and access the administration panel and
            <br />
            you can hit the /dashboard section for the deployd dashboard
