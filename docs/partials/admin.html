<dcs-container title="admin &raquo; controls" title-level="3" spy-title="controls" spy-level="2">
    <dcs-intro>
        Going through the jsnbt pages and sections, you constantly find yourself in forms full of input controls.<br />
        If a template is accompanied with a form file, the html notation on that file could extend the jsnbt form with more controls to save data to the target database object.
        <br /><br />
        The controls are angular directives, therefore they may be injected in the control collection easily from any module to enrich a form's functionality.
        <br /><br />
        Here we'll have a look at the default controls shipped with jsnbt:
