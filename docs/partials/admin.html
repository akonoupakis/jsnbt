        <h3 data-spy-title="dashboard" data-spy-level="2">dashboard</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                this will be a dashboard area for the site and the admin.<br />
                modules you install might inject their dashboard widgets to this area
            </p>
            <p>
                in your end custom site, you may have an html file installed on src/web/admin/tmpl/public/ and reference it in your config injects section for dashboard.<br />
                accompanying this file with an angular controller, you may inject functionality in the admin working with the existing admin functions or any of your own
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 data-spy-title="content" data-spy-level="2">content</h3>

                this file can include controls that bind their values to the data layout object, therefore saving a layout entry with whatever fields your site needs.<br />
                this data, can be then bound to a node, and be used in the template in the front site
            </p>

            <h4 data-spy-title="nodes" data-spy-level="3">nodes</h4>
            <p>
