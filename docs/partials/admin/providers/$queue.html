<p>$queue came at a need's moment, not used anymore, but it served its point well so it has not been thrown away</p>
<p>This is a promised functions queue, triggering each entry in turn until the queue is empty</p>
<p>The need came on saving a document on each change of a user input, which was proven to be quite too often and was having race condition issues</p>
<p>$queue gave a solution saving the document in series waiting for the previous save functions to be completed first</p>
<pre>(function () {
    
    angular.module("jsnbt")
        .controller('AppController', function ($scope, $q, $queue) {

            $scope.inputValue = 'test'; // assume you have an html input element bound to this scope model
            
            $scope.saveValue = function () {
                var deferred = $q.defer();                

                save($scope.inputValue, function(callback) {
                    deferred.resolve(); 
                });

                return deferred.promise;
            };

            $scope.$watch('inputValue', function (newValue, prevValue) {
                $queue.enqueue('queueName', $scope.saveValue);
            });

        });

})();</pre>
