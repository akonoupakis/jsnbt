<dcs-intro>Like in dashboard, you may have an html file installed on "src/web/admin/tmpl/public/" and reference it in your config injects section for content.</dcs-intro>

<dcs-container title="admin &raquo; content &raquo; languages" title-level="4" spy-title="languages" spy-level="4">
    <p>
        Here you are able to administer the site languages.<br />
        If you define in your site config that you do not want localization on your site (locale: 'en'), this section will not be visible.
    </p>    
</dcs-container>

<dcs-container title="admin &raquo; content &raquo; layouts" title-level="4" spy-title="layouts" spy-level="4">
    <p>
        The layouts are defined on your site config as a key value collection linking each layout with a partial html file.<br />
        This file can include controls that bind their values to the data layout object, therefore saving a layout entry with whatever fields your site needs.<br />
        This data, can be then bound to a node, and be used in the template in the front site.
    </p>
</dcs-container>

<dcs-container title="admin &raquo; content &raquo; nodes" title-level="4" spy-title="nodes" spy-level="4">
    <p>
        The nodes represent the endpoints that will result in your site urls.
        <br />
        Each node is defined a seo name that will be part of the end url.
    </p>
    <p>Depending on the node entity, you might have extra or less input controls, but here's a few that matter:</p>
