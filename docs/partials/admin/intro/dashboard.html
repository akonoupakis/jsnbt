    This will be a dashboard area for the site and the admin.<br />
    Modules you install might inject their dashboard widgets to this area.

    In your end custom site, you may have an html file installed on "src/web/admin/tmpl/public/" and reference it in your config injects section for dashboard.<br />
    Accompanying this file with an angular controller, you may inject functionality in the admin working with the existing admin functions or any of your own.
