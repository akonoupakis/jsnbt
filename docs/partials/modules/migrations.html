<p>So far, all good. You define the site collections and start populating the data.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, you will introduce new functionality that requires changes in one of your collections.<br />
    Using mongo as the datasource, structural changes are automatic. What happens with changes in the data though?</p>
<p>Each module may record a number of scripts under a /src/dat/ folder named alphabetically in the order that they need to be run against the database ()e.g. 20150402a-init.js, 20150404a-addedSmth.js, 20150404b-addedSmthElse.js).</p>
<p>The status of the migration scripts are captured in the "migrations" data collection.</p>
<p>A data migration script should look like:</p>
<dcs-code>module.exports = {

    process: function (db, next, error) {
        // process here the db and call next();
        next();
    }

};</dcs-code>
