<p>
    Upon grunt, all installed modules are fetched from node_modules and their file system is coppied to "src/pck/".
    <br />
    The "src/pck/" folder should be ignored from any source control services, as it is auto generated.
    <br />
    Afterwards, the module files from "src/pck/" along with the underlying module files, are deployd in turn to the deployment folder ("www/").
