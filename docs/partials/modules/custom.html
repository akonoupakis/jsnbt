<p>
    Modules are typically npm packages.<br />
    They are to be downloaded from the public npm repositories and be used as is.<br />
    <br />
    In the case that you need the module private, you will want to keep its code within your jsnbt site solution.
    <br />
    For that purpose, jsnbt provides the "npm/" folder. Grunt will get the installed npm modules from "node_modules/" as well as the packages located at "npm/", and deploy their files in the very same way.
    <br /><br />
    So, you need a few custom private modules for your end site? put them under "npm/".
