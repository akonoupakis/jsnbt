    Content that might come from a module, is accessible from its entry in the modules list.
</p><p>
    Common content is a tree control, or a grid control displaying the content of the module driven by database data. 
    <br />
    The nodes of such a tree control, could be linked to pointer nodes from the main nodes tree in jsnbt, extending its url structure.
    <br />
    <br />
    In future versions of this cms, a module might as well inject implemented widgets to the jsnbt dashboard.
