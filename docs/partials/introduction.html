<p>This is the first decent attempt to create a cms.</p>
<p>The previous versions were developed in a different pattern on .Net with sql. This time, we tried more open source solutions. We found that node combined with mongoDB was quite appealing.</p>
<p>The nodeJs infrastructure came in with an advantage. As an open source project, it could have the feedback from a larger developer variety as everyone copes with javascript. So why do it on .Net or PHP and limit that number?</p>
<p>The name Jsonbot case without thought as everything on this project relates homehow to js json objects.</p>
<p>The cms is supposed to be an engine that enables the rapid development of a target site. This cms will work with modules; modular components that could be as well installed besides jsnbt, adding functionality to the admin and to the rewriter functions</p>
