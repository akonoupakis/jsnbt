            deployd is an open source api platform, which is widely used by jsnbt.
            <br />
            deployd is installed as a dependency so you don't have to install it yourself. you just watch the magic come to you!
        </p>
        <p>
            on deployd, you may define your database collections and the main field properties that they might include.
            <br />
            also, you may define server side code to be triggered upon crud events of each table
            <br />
            both of the above, configurable by files injected into the deployd mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            all deployd collection resources, are available on their respective urls (rest), but for jsnbt this has been changed to be under /jsnbt/
            <br />
            lastly, deployd offers a client side api (dpd.js) to be used for rapid dal with the database!
        </p>
        <p>
            as soon as you install jsnbt, you may find the deployd panel at /dashboard
            <br />
            the config files for the deployd resources, come from the (later mentioned) modules on their /src/dpd path
