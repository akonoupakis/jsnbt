    deployd is an open source api platform, which is widely used by jsnbt.
    <br />
    deployd is installed as a dependency so you don't have to install it yourself. you just watch the magic come to you!
</p>
<p>
    On deployd, you may define your database collections and the main field properties that they might include.
    <br />
    Also, you may define server side code to be triggered upon crud events of each table.
    <br />
    Both of the above, configurable by files injected into the deployd mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    All deployd collection resources, are available on their respective urls (rest), but for jsnbt this has been changed to be under "jsnbt/".
    <br />
    Lastly, deployd offers a client side api (dpd.js) to be used for rapid dal with the database!
</p>
<p>
    As soon as you install jsnbt, you may find the deployd panel at "/dashboard".
