    deployd
</h2>
	deployd is an open source api platform, which is widely used by jsnbt.
	deployd is installed as a dependency so you don't have to install it yourself. you just watch the magic come to you!

	on deployd, you may define your database collections and the main field properties that they might include.
	also, you may define server side code to be triggered upon crud events of each table
	both of the above, configurable by files injected into the deployd mechanism.

	all deployd collection resources, are available on their respective urls (rest), but for jsnbt this has been changed to be under /jsnbt/
	lastly, deployd offers a client side api (dpd.js) to be used for rapid dal with the database!

	as soon as you install jsnbt, you may find the deployd panel at /dashboard
	the config files for the deployd resources, come from the (later mentioned) modules on their /src/dpd path
