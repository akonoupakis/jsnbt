<p>As you already think, this seems a lot like the one-page apps that are all around. True. Everything loads when the dom is ready.</p>
<p>
    Search engine spider bots do not like that very much, but we have predicted a little something for it.<br />
    When a request comes from a spider bot, the application will have phantom to request the same page so that the ready made page html can be served back to the bot.</p>
<p>
    Quite simple as that! This is the reason that you will need to have phantom installed on your server running jsnbt.
