<p><b>?dbg=true</b> : enabled a logger that runs through the current request. On html load debug info will be logged in your browser's console.</p>
<p><b>?dbg=true&type=json</b> : prints the debug info in json format</p>
<p><b>?prerender=true</b> : prerenders the page as it would have been prerendered upon a visit from a search engine bot (needs a sa user to be logged in!)</p>
