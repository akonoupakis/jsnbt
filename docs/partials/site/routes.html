<p>
    jsnbt provides custom routes and a "custom" entity for the code nodes.
</p><p>
    The custom routes are defined in the module's config file, and can be selected for a custom node as their custom routing process. An appropriate function should be placed in the root of the module's index file passing the request context as a parameter.
</p>
<p>So, you dont fancy the jsnbt routers? or you need something more specific to your needs? develop it!</p>
