<p>
    Grunt is a task runner.
</p>
<p>
    We use grunt to prepare the a target folder with the nessesary app files for deployment.
</p>
<p>
    In general lines, grunting, gets the files from all installed modules from their "src/" folders and merges them to the deployment folder target  ("dev/" or "dist/").
</p>
<p>
    Upon grunt, the "src/public/" ends to "{target}/public/" and the "src/admin/" ends to "{target}/public/admin/" ready as wanted by the app so that the admin would reside in a "/admin" directory.
</p>
<p>
    The "src/app/" location containing all server side code is left out as it is always triggered from the downloaded npm packages, from "node_modules".

<h4>update-files switch</h4>
<p>
    Grunt utilizes a files watch, and if the update-files switch is defined (e.g. grunt dev update-files), grunt will monitor any changes on your src files and re-deploy them to the deployment target folder when modified.
    <br /><br />
    Try <b>grunt dev/prod update-files</b>
