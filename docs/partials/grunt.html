    grunt
</h2>
	grunt is a task runner.

we use grunt to prepare the a target folder with the nessesary app files for deployment.

in general lines, grunting, gets the files from all installed modules from their "src" folders and merges them to the deployment folder target  ("dev" or "dist")

upon grunt, the "src/public" ends to "{target}/public" and the "src/admin" ends to {target}/public/admin ready as wanted by the app so that the admin would reside in a "/admin" directory.
the deployd resource configuration files, are merged together and copied from "src/dpd" to "{target}/dpd"

the "src/app" location containing all server side code is left out as it is always triggered from the downloaded npm packages, from  "node_modules"

DEV:

downloads bower packages
sets the deployment environment to "dev"
cleans the target deployment folder ("dev")
copies the module files from "src/web" to the target deployment folder ("dev")
copies the "src/pck" files from all other installed modules to the target deployment folder ("dev")
copies the "src/dpd" resource files to the target deployment folder ("dev"), merging them with any existing ones.
deploys the downloaded bower packages to the target deployment folder ("dev"), depending on the bower.json "deploy" section
performs less parsing on the copied less files
preprocess the copied html templates depending on the deployment target (on "dev", it preprocess the templates and leaves the unminified resources)

PROD:

downloads bower packages
sets the deployment environment to "dist"
cleans the target deployment folder ("dist")
copies the module files from "src/web" to the target deployment folder ("dist")
copies the "src/pck" files from all other installed modules to the target deployment folder ("dist")
copies the "src/dpd" resource files to the target deployment folder ("dist"), merging them with any existing ones.
deploys the downloaded bower packages to the target deployment folder ("dist"), depending on the bower.json "deploy" section
performs less parsing on the copied less files
preprocess the copied html templates depending on the deployment target (on "dist", it preprocess the templates and leaves the unminified resources)
minifies the parsed less response
uglifies copies js files

update-files switch

grunt utilizes a files watch, and if the update-files switch is defined (e.g. grunt dev update-files), grunt will monitor any changes on your src files and re-deploy them to the deployment target folder when modified.
try grunt dev/prod update-files
