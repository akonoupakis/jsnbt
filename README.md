## overview
```
Getting its name from our well-known json objects, working with NodeJs and MongoDB, 
jsnbt could grow to be a fast driven CMS for any purpose.

upon install, reroute to /admin to create your first time user.
create the available languages and content nodes (system urls)
```	
	
## quick start

### install
```
> NodeJs : http://nodejs.org/download/
> MongoDB : https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
> ImageMagick : http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php
> PhantomJs: http://phantomjs.org/download.html

> bower : npm install -g bower
> gulp : npm install -g gulp
```
### bootstrap
```
download a copy of the jsnbt-angular-strap from 
https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular

change the name to your site's name on package.json

change the hosts and database configuration on hosts.js
```	

### run
```
npm install - for gulp dependencies mentioned on package.json
npm install jsnbt --save - install the jsnbt and save it to package.json

gulp dev/prod - prepares the application folder for the web server to serve
(you may use "gulp dev-update" to monitor changes in the filesystem 
and apply them to the application folder while developing)

node server-app.js - runs the webserver

if all worked smoothly, you will be able to see the jsnbt admin at /admin 
which will ask you for a first time registration to set you up with 
an sa account

go ahead, create a language, create a page, and enjoy!
