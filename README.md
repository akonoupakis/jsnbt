# jsnbt

## overview

	Getting its name from our well-known json objects, 
	working with NodeJs and MongoDB, 
	jsnbt could grow to be a fast driven CMS for any purpose.

	upon install, reroute to /admin to create your first time user.
	create the available languages and content nodes (system urls)


## note

	unfortunatelly, too many things are changing on developing jsnbt for a first time use, 
	and combined with the lack of time, I am still unable to maintain a changelog or even
	a stable version.

	please bear with me until I prepare for you some proper documentation!
	
## quick start

### install

	NodeJs : http://nodejs.org/download/

	MongoDB : https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
	
	GraphicsMagick : http://www.graphicsmagick.org/download.html

	PhantomJs: http://phantomjs.org/download.html

	bower : npm install -g bower
	grunt : npm install -g grunt-cli

### bootstrap

	download a copy of the jsnbt-angular-strap from 
	https://github.com/akonoupakis/jsnbt-strap-angular

	change the name to your site's name on package.json and bower.json
	
	change the database configuration on config.js for dev and production environments
	

### run

	npm install - for grunt dependencies mentioned on package.json
	npm install jsnbt --save - install the jsnbt and save it to package.json

	grunt dev/prod - prepares the application folder for the web server to serve
	(you may use "grunt dev update-files" to monitor changes in the filesystem 
	and apply them to the application folder while developing)
	
	node server-dev.js (or node server-prod.js) - runs the webserver

	if all worked smoothly, you will be able to se the deployd dashboard at /dashboard 
	and the jsnbt admin at /admin which will ask you for a first time registration 
	to set you up with an sa account

	go ahead, create a language, create a page, and start!
